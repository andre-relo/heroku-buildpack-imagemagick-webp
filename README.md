heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-webp
===========================

Use [ImageMagick](www.imagemagick.org) built with [libwebp](https://code.google.com/p/webp/) inside a Heroku `heroku-16` environment. This buildpack will download both libraries, build them from source and install them along side your app. Your ```$PATH``` and ```$LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` will also be updated to use this version of ImageMagick instead of the default Heroku one, which does _not_ currently have libwebp support.

Since this buildpack is building libwebp and ImageMagick from source your first deploy will take a very long time (around 10 mins). However after building once the installed libraries are stored in a cache directory and will be used for all future deploys. If for any reason you want to force a rebuild of libwebp and ImageMagick, please check out the [heroku-repo](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo) plugin.

## Usage

List your buildpacks:
```
heroku buildpacks -a appname
```

Add this buildpack to your app (specify hash to lock down verison):
```
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/andre-relo/heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-webp.git#abc123 -a appname
```


## Verify Installation & Version

You can verify that ImageMagick was built with libwebp support by running the following:

```
heroku run "identify -list format" -a appname
```

If the output includes ```WEBP* rw-   WebP Image Format (libwebp 0.4.2)``` then you're all set.

## Verify the correct ImageMagic version

```
heroku run "identify --version" -a appname
```


If this failed, and you want to [clear the buildpack cache](https://help.heroku.com/18PI5RSY/how-do-i-clear-the-build-cache) to try again:

```
heroku plugins:install heroku-repo -a appname
heroku repo:purge_cache -a appname
```

Then, adjust your buildpacks as necessary and re-run your deploy:

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "Updated buildpacks"
git push origin master
```

## Heroku CI
Add this buildpack to your [app.json](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/app-json-schema) file if you're using Heroku's continuous integration / pipelines.

```

## Updating The Binary

Only the release versions that end in `-10` are available long-term from `https://www.imagemagick.org/download/releases/`. For example, `6.5.8-10` has been available there for years.

For the most recent versions, it's recommended to source the file elsewhere.
